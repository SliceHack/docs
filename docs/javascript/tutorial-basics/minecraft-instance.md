# Minecraft Instance

You can use the `mc` variable in the project to access the Minecraft instance

```js
mc.thePlayer.jump();
```

```js
mc.thePlayer.motionY = 0.5;
```

```js
mc.thePlayer.setPosition(0, 0, 0);
```

(Any Method from the Minecraft class can be used)

That's crazy right you can access the Minecraft instance in JavaScript!
